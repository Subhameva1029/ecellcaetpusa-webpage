                         ideas and model. It was very difficult to select the best model because many models were newsworthy.

            It was the event which made all of us proud of what we were doing. We could felt the entrepreneurial 
            spirit which we all anticipated from the very start of this e-cell. With this we went on arranging many more programmes which up to some extend did encouraged the youth.
            Lastly there is not much left to write about E-cell CAET pusa other than the fact that they
             are doing a really good work and I hope that they keep on organising programmes in future to keep the entrepreneurial spirit active in the youngsters.
